/*
Creating a morsecode_prop.h for your lightsaber, where the power and/or aux buttons are used to type Morse code, involves capturing button inputs, interpreting them as Morse code, and then triggering effects either on the blade or through the speaker based on which button is used.

Here's a basic outline of how this could be implemented:
1. Define the Morse Code Mapping

First, you need to define the Morse code for each character (letters, numbers, etc.).

2. Capture Button Presses

You need to capture button presses and translate them into Morse code input. A press would register as a dot, a longer hold as a dash.
3. Implement Timing Logic

Timing is crucial for Morse code interpretation. You would need to measure how long the button is held down and released to distinguish between dots and dashes.
4. Playback the Morse Code

Once a valid Morse code sequence is input, it can be played back using the blade effects (if the power button is used) or via sound (if the aux button is used).
Example Implementation

Here’s a simplified example:
*/
/*
To create a morsecode_prop.h for your lightsaber that plays Morse code on the blade and speaker with the specified colors for letters and numbers, here's how you can approach it:
Step-by-Step Implementation

    Define Morse Code Map: Create a map to associate each letter and number with its corresponding Morse code pattern.

    Handle Button Events: Detect when the power or aux button is pressed to input Morse code. Store the input sequence.

    Interpret Morse Code: Translate the input sequence into letters or numbers.

    Control Blade Colors: Use different colors for letters (blue) and numbers (red) when the Morse code is typed on the power button.

    Play Sound: If the Morse code is typed on the aux button, play the corresponding sound on the speaker.

Example Code Structure

Here's a simplified version of what the code might look like:
*/
/*
To enhance your morsecode_prop.h and add the desired features such as blade effects (configured through my_config.h) and OLED screen integration, here's what we can do:
1. Blade Effects in my_config.h

You can define specific blade effects for the Morse code in your my_config.h file using the EffectSequence and BladeStyles. Here's a breakdown of how to approach it:

    Blue Blade for Letters: Define a blade effect for letters in Morse code.
    Red Blade for Numbers: Define a blade effect for numbers in Morse code.

Here's how you might define these effects in your my_config.h:*/

// Blade effects for Morse code
StylePtr<InOutHelper<White, Black>> MorseLetterStyle = StylePtr<Red>();  // For numbers
StylePtr<InOutHelper<Blue, Black>> MorseNumberStyle = StylePtr<Blue>();  // For letters

/*
Then, in the MorseCode prop, trigger these effects depending on the character type (letter or number).
2. Blade Effects Configuration

In your MorseCode::PlayOnBlade function, call the appropriate effect from the my_config.h file. For instance, if the input is a letter, you trigger the MorseLetterStyle, and if it's a number, you trigger MorseNumberStyle.
3. OLED Screen Integration

Yes, it's possible to integrate the OLED screen to display the typed Morse code and the decoded character. You would need to handle OLED rendering in your prop.

The top half of the screen will show the Morse code input (dots and dashes), while the bottom will display the decoded character. You can use the following methods:

    ProffieOS's oled.h: Use the OLED API functions like DisplayText() to manage OLED content.

Example integration in your MorseCode prop:
*/
/*
To handle the case where the OLED screen might not be included in my_config.h, you can add conditional compilation checks based on whether the OLED library is included. This way, if the OLED screen isn't defined, the related code will be ignored or disabled.

Here’s how you can adjust the code in morsecode_prop.h to achieve this:
morsecode_prop.h
*/
/*
Updates:

    Conditional OLED Handling: The OLED-related code is wrapped inside #ifdef ENABLE_OLED. This condition checks if OLED functionality has been enabled in my_config.h. If ENABLE_OLED is defined, the OLED-related code is included; otherwise, it is ignored or disabled.

    my_config.h: Add the ENABLE_OLED definition to enable OLED support.

my_config.h
*/
/*
Notes:

    OLED Support: You can now control whether the OLED screen is used by defining or omitting #define ENABLE_OLED in my_config.h. If the OLED screen is not included, the code that updates the screen will be ignored.
    Blade Effects: The Morse code characters will still trigger the correct blade effects (blue for letters, red for numbers) regardless of whether the OLED is enabled.

This setup ensures that the OLED screen is optional, and its absence won’t interfere with the rest of the functionality.
*/
/*
what would happen on the OLED screen, if #define USE_AUREBESH_FONT was used in my_config.h ?
*/
/*
If #define USE_AUREBESH_FONT is used in my_config.h, it means that the OLED display will be using the Aurebesh font instead of the default font (likely Latin-based characters). Here’s how that would affect the OLED screen behavior in your morsecode_prop.h file:

    Morse Code Display (Top Half): The typed Morse code (dots and dashes) will not be affected, as those symbols (dots . and dashes -) exist in most fonts, including Aurebesh. So, the OLED screen will still correctly display the Morse code sequence on the top half of the screen.

    Decoded Character (Bottom Half): If you are displaying letters (A-Z) or numbers (0-9) as decoded characters, the effect depends on how Aurebesh is implemented:
        If the Aurebesh font supports the full alphabet (A-Z) and numbers, the OLED will show the Aurebesh representation of these characters.
        If the Aurebesh font replaces standard Latin letters with Aurebesh symbols, the characters displayed on the OLED will be the Aurebesh equivalents. This means instead of seeing "A" or "1", you’ll see the corresponding Aurebesh symbol for those characters.

Example Behavior:

    Without Aurebesh:
        Top half: ..- (Morse code for "U")
        Bottom half: U (decoded letter)

    With Aurebesh Font:
        Top half: ..- (Morse code for "U" stays the same)
        Bottom half: Aurebesh symbol for "U" (instead of the Latin "U", you'll see the Aurebesh equivalent).

How to Handle This in Code:

If you want to toggle between Aurebesh and standard characters dynamically (or choose what to display based on the font), you can conditionally modify the character handling depending on whether USE_AUREBESH_FONT is defined. For example, you might want to display the decoded Morse character using the Aurebesh font if it's enabled or use the Latin alphabet if it's not.
Conditional Handling Example:

In your morsecode_prop.h file, you can add conditional logic for handling Aurebesh as follows:
*/
/*
In this case, you would need a TranslateToAurebesh() function that maps the decoded character (A-Z, 0-9) to the corresponding Aurebesh glyph.
Conclusion:

    If #define USE_AUREBESH_FONT is used, the OLED screen will display Aurebesh characters instead of Latin characters for the decoded Morse code.
    The Morse code itself (dots and dashes) should remain unaffected.
    You can add conditional logic in your code to handle the display based on whether Aurebesh is enabled or not.
*/
/*
What if I want both the aurebesh and latin character to be displayed at the same time, aurebesh first and latin second, whether #define USE_AUREBESH_FONT was used in my_config.h or not ? Can you give me the full code and the code to add to my_config.h
*/
/*
To display both Aurebesh and Latin characters simultaneously on the OLED screen, we need to ensure that the Aurebesh font is used only when available, and the Latin characters are displayed afterward regardless. Here’s the full code for your morsecode_prop.h file and the necessary additions for my_config.h.
Code for morsecode_prop.h:

/*
To display both Aurebesh and Latin characters on the OLED screen, regardless of whether #define USE_AUREBESH_FONT is present in my_config.h, we can update the code to handle this condition programmatically and ensure both scripts are displayed together.

Here’s how you can implement it:

    Update the OLED code in morsecode_prop.h to handle both Aurebesh and Latin characters.
    Add necessary configurations in my_config.h to enable or disable the OLED as needed.

/*
Explanation:

    Aurebesh Map: The aurebeshMap now directly contains Unicode representations of the Aurebesh glyphs (e.g., 𐤀 for "A"). These are mapped to Latin letters and numbers as in the morseCodeMap.

    DisplayOnOLED: This function has been updated to look up the Aurebesh character from the new aurebeshMap. It prints the Aurebesh glyph first, then prints the corresponding Latin character below it on the OLED screen.

    Button Events: The Morse code interpretation remains the same. When a valid character is decoded, it will be displayed on the OLED with both the Aurebesh and Latin character regardless of the configuration in my_config.h.

Changes to my_config.h

To handle the OLED screen and ensure that both Aurebesh and Latin characters are displayed, add the following code to my_config.h:
*/

#ifdef ENABLE_OLED
#define oled_enabled true
#else
#define oled_enabled false
#endif

// Ensure that the OLED driver is enabled if available
#ifdef ENABLE_OLED
#include "oled_driver.h"
extern OledDisplay oled_display;
#endif

/*
This will enable OLED functionality if ENABLE_OLED is defined, and both Aurebesh and Latin characters will be displayed side by side as intended.
*/
/*
the latin & aurebesh seems inverted in the code for "2", "3", "4" & "5" above but when I copy the code and paste it in my document, it is not inverted. Do you know why ?
*/
/*
The issue you're describing, where the Latin and Aurebesh characters seem inverted for "2", "3", "4", and "5" in the code displayed here but appear correctly when pasted into your document, is likely due to how the Unicode characters are rendered on the display of this platform. Some text rendering engines can interpret and display certain Unicode characters in an unusual way depending on font support, text direction, or how the platform handles specific character sets.
Why this happens:

    Rendering Differences: Platforms like this one (where you're viewing the code) may have different font rendering or Unicode handling compared to your text editor or IDE, which might fully support those characters.
    Right-to-Left Text: Aurebesh is written in a script that can sometimes be interpreted as right-to-left by Unicode renderers, which might cause them to appear reversed depending on the environment.
    Font Support: The font used here to display code might not properly handle the full range of Unicode characters, especially for specialized scripts like Aurebesh. This could cause them to display differently from how they'd appear in a fully Unicode-compliant environment.

Conclusion:

When you copy and paste the code into your document or development environment, it likely has better support for the Aurebesh Unicode characters, so the issue doesn't persist. The actual logic of the code is fine, and the problem is limited to how it’s visually represented here.

If it displays correctly in your environment and behaves as expected, you don’t need to worry about the inversion you're seeing in this context—it’s purely a rendering quirk on this platform.

/*
Breakdown of the Code:

    Morse Code Input:
        StartPress and EndPress: These functions handle button press duration to differentiate between dots (.) and dashes (-).
        The morseCode_ variable stores the Morse code sequence being input.

    Morse Code Interpretation:
        The InterpretMorse function compares the typed Morse code against the predefined morseCodeMap and returns the corresponding decoded letter or number.

    Blade and Speaker Control:
        The PlayOnBladeOrSpeaker function determines whether to play the Morse code on the blade or speaker based on which button was used.
        The PlayOnBlade function controls the blade colors using SetBladeEffect, which references the styles defined in my_config.h.
        The PlayOnSpeaker function uses a hybrid font to play sound on the speaker.

    OLED Screen Display:
        The UpdateOLED function updates the OLED screen to show the Morse code being typed in the top half and the decoded character in the bottom half.

This code will:

    Display the Morse code input and its decoded character on an OLED screen.
    Control the blade effects (blue for letters, red for numbers) based on Morse code input.
    Handle both blade effects and speaker playback depending on which button (power or aux) is used to type the Morse code.

/*
Explanation:

    Aurebesh and Latin Display: If USE_AUREBESH_FONT is defined, the OLED screen will display the Aurebesh character first, followed by the Latin character. If the define is not used, only the Latin character will be displayed.

    OLED Handling: The OLED handling code is wrapped with #ifdef OLED_ENABLE to ensure the OLED functionality is used only if the OLED screen is present and enabled. If not, the OLED functions are ignored.

    Blade and Sound Effects: The PlayOnBlade and PlayOnSpeaker functions handle the visual effects for the blade and the sound effects for the speaker, triggered by Morse code input.

This setup ensures that both Aurebesh and Latin characters are displayed when available, and the system behaves correctly regardless of whether USE_AUREBESH_FONT is defined.
*/
/*
Explanation of Key Parts:

    Morse Code Mapping: The Morse code mapping for both Latin and Aurebesh characters is defined.
    OLED Display Logic: The DisplayOnOLED() method handles the display of both Aurebesh and Latin characters. It first prints the Aurebesh character on the top half of the screen and then the corresponding Latin character on the bottom half.
    Handling Configuration: The code is designed to conditionally compile OLED-related functionality if ENABLE_OLED is defined in my_config.h. The display behavior will work whether or not USE_AUREBESH_FONT is defined.

This implementation ensures that both Aurebesh and Latin characters are displayed on the OLED screen at the same time if the OLED is available, irrespective of whether USE_AUREBESH_FONT is defined in my_config.h.
