Thank you for using my multi_prop.h prop for Proffie OS
created by olivierflying747-8 with the help of ryryog25, profezzorn & NoSloppy
you can find us at https://crucible.hubbe.net

This is still work in progress, it compiles with ProffieOS 7.14 & Arduino 1.8.19 but has not been tested on a saber.

For best enjoyment, you can add these wav files to your common directory on your SD-card.
However if you don't, a default double beeper sound will be used when you change between modes.

multi_prop.h allows for 4 (more coming) discrete prop files to be used, 
alternating on a 2 buttons extra long push (4 seconds - not customisable !) with or without a blade attached.
Blade detect function as no effect on multi_prop.h
Your prop NEEDS to have two or more buttons.
Multi_prop.h MUST be declared before the other props.
Props MUST be declared in the right order & one and only one of each type MUST be included.

This prop is for fun and not Star Wars cannon. It only exists to add extra functionality to your lightsaber, if you so choose.
Thank you for reading.

The sound files for multi_prop.h can be found on my Dropbox at:
